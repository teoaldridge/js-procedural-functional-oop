# js-procedural-functional-oop
An exercise, in which I learned the differneces between Object oriented, Functional and Procedural Programming. I created a simple functionality of inputting a userName and Password in JS, using the different paradigms in the different .js files. 

I did this exercise as as part of my learning with 'JavasScript- the Complete Guide' by Maximillian Schwarzmuller

In this exercise I learned and practiced: 
- What programming Paradigms Are
- Procedural Paradigm in practice
- Object-Oriented Paradigm in practice
- Functional Paradigm in practice
